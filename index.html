	686. "Modern work demands knowledge transfer: the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and different domains. Our most fundamental thought processes have changed to accommodate increasing complexity and the need to derive new patterns rather than rely only on familiar ones. Our conceptual classification schemes provide a scaffolding for connecting knowledge, making it accessible and flexible." - 
	David Epstein, Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World
	
	687.  “We just need more dots to connect. You should develop broad personal interests in a variety of subjects. What you present to the world should be narrow and show deep focus. In other words, generalize internally, and specialize externally.” - Chris Do.
	688. “Extreme specialization has been the greatest disaster of the modern academic world. It has created narrow Mandarins, ignorant of the universal nature of reality, incapable of connecting concepts from different fields to bring everything together in one ultimate, unified subject. The AC is everything the academic world is not. It’s about connecting everything. It demands that people be generalists, not the most narrow, blinkered specialists.”― David Sinclair 
	689. “The range of human knowledge today is so great that we're all specialists and the distance between specializations has become so great that anyone who seeks to wander freely between them almost has to forego closeness with the people around him.” ― Robert M. Pirsig
	
	690.  “Of course, I am interested, but I would not dare to talk about them. In talking about the impact of ideas in one field on ideas in another field, one is always apt to make a fool of oneself. In these days of specialization there are too few people who have such a deep understanding of two departments of our knowledge that they do not make fools of themselves in one or the other.” - Richard Feynman
	
	691. “The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyper specialization”

	**Begin of Critical thinking Quotes
	
	692. When your mind is full of assumptions, conclusions, and beliefs, it has no penetration, it just repeats past 
	impressions. --Sadhguru 
	
	693. “Responsibility to yourself means refusing to let others do your thinking, talking, and naming for you; it means learning to respect and use your own brains and instincts; hence, grappling with hard work."- 
	Adrienne Rich
	
	694. “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.” - 
	Albert Einstein
	
	695. Anaïs Nin: “When we blindly adopt a religion, a political system, a literary dogma, we become automatons. We cease to grow.”
	
	696. Anatole France: “An education isn’t how much you have committed to memory, or even how much you know. It’s being able to differentiate between what you know and what you don’t.”
	
	697. Aristotle: “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
	
	698.  “Critical thinking requires us to use our imagination, seeing things from perspectives other than our own and envisioning the likely consequences of our position.” - Bell Hooks
	
	699. “The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holder’s lack of rational conviction.” - Bertrand Russell
	
	700.  “People can be extremely intelligent, have taken a critical thinking course, and know logic inside and out. Yet they may just become clever debaters, not critical thinkers, because they are unwilling to look at their own biases.”- Carol Wade
	
	701.  “The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks.” - Christopher Hitchens
	
	702. “Learning without thought is labour lost; thought without learning is perilous.” - Confucius
	
	703. “Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It requires that we update our knowledge as new information comes in."- Daniel Levitin
	
	704.  “A problem is a chance for you to do your best.” - Duke Ellington
	
	705.  “We all have an enormous responsibility to bring to the attention of others information they do not have, which has the potential of causing them to rethink long-held ideas.” - Howard Zinn
	
	706. “The principal goal of education in the schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done; men and women who are creative, inventive, and discoverers, who can be critical and verify, and not accept, everything they are offered.” - Jean Piaget
	
	707. “We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth (such as intelligence agency or a community of scientists) or to produce good public policy (such as a legislature or advisory board)..” - Jonathan Haidt
	
	708. “We must dare to think about ‘unthinkable things’ because when things become ‘unthinkable,’ thinking stops and action becomes mindless.” - J. William Fulbright 
	
	709.  “You want to prepare your child to think as they get older. You want them to be critical in their judgments. Teaching a child, by your example, that there’s never any room for negotiating or making choices in life may suggest that you expect blind obedience, but it won’t help them, in the long run, to be discriminating in choices and thinking.” - Lawrence Balter
	
	710. “Freethinkers are those who are willing to use their minds without prejudice and without fearing to understand things that clash with their own customs, privileges, or beliefs. This state of mind is not common, but it is essential for critical thinking.” - Leo Tolstoy
	
	711. “Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood.” - Marie Curie
	
	712. “To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half-truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.” - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr 
	
	713. Mason Cooley: “The critical spirit never knows when to stop meddling.”
	
	714. Max Beerbohm: “The one real goal of education is to leave a person asking questions.”

	716. Noam Chomsky: “I try to encourage people to think for themselves, to question standard assumptions…Don’t take assumptions for granted. Begin by taking a sceptical attitude toward anything that is conventional wisdom. Make it justify itself. It usually can’t. Be willing to ask questions about what is taken for granted. Try to think things through for yourself.”
	
	717. Oliver Wendell Holmes: “A mind stretched by new ideas never goes back to its original dimensions.”
	
	718. Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail.”
	
	719. Randi Weingarten: “Standardized testing is at cross purposes with many of the most important purposes of public education. It doesn’t measure big-picture learning, critical thinking, perseverance, problem-solving, creativity, or curiosity; yet, those are the qualities great teaching brings out in a student.”
	
	720. Richard Dawkins: “Do not indoctrinate your children. Teach them how to think for themselves, how to evaluate evidence, and how to disagree with you.”
	
	721. Richard Feynman: “We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress.”
	
	722. Stanley Kubrick: “If chess has any relationship to film-making, it would be in the way it helps you develop patience and discipline in choosing between alternatives at a time when an impulsive decision seems very attractive.”
	
	723. Steve Jobs: “Simple can be harder than complex: you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
	
	724. Terry Heick: “Critical thinking is certainly a ‘skill’ but when possessed as a mindset–a playful and humble willingness–it shifts from a labour to an art. It asks, ‘Is this true? By what standard?”
	
	725. Thomas J. Watson, Sr.: “Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the danger of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of crackpot than the stigma of conformity.”
	
	726. Sir William Bragg: “The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them.” 
	
	727. William James: “A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.”
